# spotify_top_50

In this folder, I am working with a dataset of around ~610 songs from 2010-2019.

In each file, my goal is to try and find out what features makes a song popular.

I am using different methods, some statisticall heavy, and others more focused on Machine Learning. I will continue to update this folder as I progress in this!

## As of April 4, I have attempted to predict popularity using:
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. PCA/k-Means Clusters
3. Decision Trees/Random Forest

If you have something you would like to see, let me know!

I feel I have sucked out what I can out of this dataset. I will be moving on to new projects!
